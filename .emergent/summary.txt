The AI engineer's work primarily focused on refining the  customer management features, particularly the  and  pages, and the  (customer profile). The trajectory began with a necessary revert of the  page to its original state due to previous incorrect modernizations. Subsequent work involved re-implementing core functionalities like duplicate customer detection (backend and frontend), and dynamically adjusting the Company form's Contact Persons layout and Owner/Operator toggle. Google Places API integration was added for company/billing addresses. Significant effort was dedicated to fixing numerous 422 API validation errors, addressing JSX parsing errors across different pages (e.g., sites detail, customer edit), and implementing custom success/error modals to replace default browser pop-ups. The customer profile page received tab reorganization, linked company display, full-width layout, and an archive customer feature with a custom confirmation modal. A major task involved completely rebuilding the customer edit page to mirror the create page's extensive features, which required meticulous field initialization fixes. The work concluded mid-implementation of a custom success modal for the archive customer action.

The objective is to create an intuitive admin dashboard for customer management. Key requirements for the  page include: dynamic toggles for Link to Company, Communication Preference (SMS/InApp), Require Access, and Create Site. UI/UX updates involved renaming Individual to Contact, improving Google address input, and adding document/photo upload. A significant overhaul was needed for Company customer forms, requiring Legal Business Name and Operating As fields, separate Google Autocomplete-integrated Company Address and Billing Address, Office Number, Email, and dynamic Contact Persons fields (Manager, Accounting, Supervisor) with an Owner/Operator toggle that collapses secondary contacts. Accounting Information (Business Number, Payment Terms, Credit Limit, Preferred Payment Method) also needed updating, with conditional address display and dynamic button text. Comprehensive form validation with error highlighting and US phone number formatting were critical. Later requests extended to integrating Unified Communications Center features into customer/company profile pages (filtered), removing Quick Compose from the main communications center, and removing dispatch dashboard navigation links. The customer profile page needed tabs reordered, Communications renamed to Comms, and Service Requests and Forms tabs removed. It also needed a full-width display, showing linked company info on the overview tab, and an Archive Customer button in the header with a custom confirmation modal.

<code_architecture>
The application is structured as a monorepo within the  directory, encompassing  (FastAPI),  (Expo mobile), and  (Next.js dashboard).



-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Main FastAPI server file, defines API endpoints.
    -   **Changes:** Added a new  POST endpoint to detect existing customers by phone or email, which returns  and matched fields.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Defines Pydantic data models for the backend, including customer and site structures.
    -   **Changes:** Examined to understand , , , , and  models for correct frontend data submission.  and  were confirmed as optional in customer models.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Core customer creation interface.
    -   **Changes:** Fully reverted to original state, then extensively re-modified. Re-implemented duplicate customer detection with a modal. Contact Persons section re-designed for inline fields and an Owner/Operator toggle. Google Places API integrated for Company and Billing Addresses. Implemented custom success/error modals for form submission. Addressed a 422 API error by conditionally sending address data for company customers. Fixed a 422 API error during site creation by correcting  and  fields. Restored the Company Address/Billing Address section and made it conditionally visible for company customers, while hiding the standard address UI for company types. Enhanced company linking to robustly save  when a customer is linked to a company. Debugged city population for Google Places.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Interface for editing existing customer information.
    -   **Changes:** Initially fixed a missing  import. Then, the entire file content was replaced with a copy of  to ensure feature parity for editing. Subsequently, fixed a runtime error where  was  by ensuring proper initialization of the  array and other missing fields (, , etc.) when loading existing customer data.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Displays detailed information for a specific customer or company.
    -   **Changes:** Made the main content area full-width. Reordered and renamed tabs (e.g., Communications to Comms). Removed Service Requests and Forms tabs and their associated content. Added display for Linked Company information directly into the Contact Information section on the Overview tab. Added an Archive button to the  actions, including a confirmation modal and the  function to interact with the backend API. The archive confirmation modal's styling was updated to match the custom error modal. A  was added to replace the browser's alert upon successful archive.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was immediately engaged in finalizing the implementation of the custom success modal for the customer archive functionality on the customer profile page (). This involved adding the  state, updating the  function to utilize this modal instead of a generic browser alert, and adding the JSX structure for the success modal itself. This work was explicitly stated as being in progress before the request for a summary was made. The  is responsible for making an API call to archive the customer and then displaying this success feedback to the user.
