The AI engineer systematically evolved the  page in the  application, addressing numerous iterative user requests. Key feature additions included file upload with backend integration and error handling, comprehensive Google Places API integration for addresses, and improved communication preference management. A significant effort was dedicated to refactoring the Company customer creation form, introducing dynamic contact structures, updated accounting fields, and conditional UI elements. The engineer also encountered and resolved several critical issues, such as 502 proxy errors (due to large file uploads), 422 validation errors (due to schema mismatches), and persistent build errors (due to  remnants), often requiring careful debugging and service restarts. The work involved meticulous UI/UX adjustments, state management, and backend model updates, with a continuous focus on form validation and user feedback.

The application, an admin dashboard, requires a highly intuitive UI/UX for customer management. The core task revolved around enhancing the  page. Initial requirements involved implementing a Link to Company toggle, Communication Preference options (SMS/InApp) dictating mobile number requirements, a Require Access toggle for user roles, and a Create Site toggle. UI/UX refinements, replacing Individual with Contact, enhancing Google address input, and repositioning form elements were crucial. Document/photo upload functionality under Additional Information was also requested. Later, a major overhaul of the Company customer form was requested, including distinct layout for Legal Business Name and Operating As, separate Company Address and Billing Address fields with Google Autocomplete, Office Number, Email, dynamic Contact Persons fields (Manager, Accounting, Supervisor) with a toggle to combine them, updated Accounting Information (Business Number, Payment Terms, Credit Limit toggle, Preferred Payment Method), conditional address display, and dynamic button text. Comprehensive form validation with red error highlighting was also a critical request.

- ** (Heavily MODIFIED):**
    - **Importance:** This is the core customer creation/editing interface, featuring complex forms and dynamic UI.
    - **Changes:** Extensive modifications to implement Link to Company toggle, Communication Preference controls, Require Access system, Create Site toggle, and numerous layout and styling adjustments. Integrated file upload functionality, including state management (, , ) and handler functions (, , ), and its submission to the backend. Replaced Individual with Contact. Enhanced Google Places API integration for address auto-completion and city population. Implemented a Copy from Phone button. Introduced and later removed/re-implemented (due to bugs) duplicate customer detection with modal popups. Redesigned the Company customer form, including Legal Business Name, Operating As, conditional Company Address and Billing Address with Google Autocomplete, updated Contact Persons section (Manager, Accounting, Supervisor roles, single-person toggle), and revised Accounting Information. Addressed page scrolling, implemented dynamic Create Customer/Create Company button text, and added comprehensive form validation with red highlighting for invalid fields. Debugged and removed old  references causing build errors. Adjusted site creation payload to expect a  object.
- ** (MODIFIED):**
    - **Importance:** Defines the Pydantic data models for the FastAPI backend, ensuring data integrity.
    - **Changes:** Added fields such as , , , , ,  (Optional[str]), and  (Optional[List[dict]]) to the  model. The  model was updated to use , , . A  model (latitude, longitude, address fields) and a  model (requiring a  object) were defined to support site creation.
- ** (MODIFIED):**
    - **Importance:** The main FastAPI application entry point, responsible for routing and integrating backend services.
    - **Changes:** Modified the  POST endpoint () to handle new fields from the frontend, including attachments, and to conditionally invoke user creation and email services based on .
- ** (NEW):**
    - **Importance:** Handles the business logic for user account creation.
    - **Changes:** Created to encapsulate password hashing, user database entry, and managing user-specific access.
- ** (MODIFIED):**
    - **Importance:** Manages outbound email communication.
    - **Changes:** Added a  method to send login details, dynamically fetching templates from the database.
- ** (NEW):**
    - **Importance:** Script to populate the database with essential email templates.
    - **Changes:** Created to insert a default login credentials email template into MongoDB.

<pending_tasks>
- Update the multiple contacts compact layout within the Company form's Contact Persons section to include proper phone number and email formatting and validation.
- Re-implement the duplicate customer detection and modal popup system, which was temporarily removed due to a grey screen build error.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of enhancing the Contact Persons section within the Company customer creation form on . Specifically, the task involves applying proper phone number and email formatting, along with corresponding validation, to the contact fields. The previous action successfully updated the single contact form layout. The immediate next step is to locate and modify the multiple contacts compact layout to ensure these formatting and validation rules are consistently applied across all contact person entries in the Company form, adhering to the user's request for consistent phone/email behavior.
