The AI engineer systematically developed a comprehensive customer creation page, responding to numerous iterative user requests. Initially, the task involved refining an existing Link to Company toggle and search functionality, including debugging UI rendering issues and backend service conflicts. Subsequently, major features were added: a Communication Preference section (SMS/InApp) influencing mobile number validation, a robust Require Access system with user role assignment and email credentials (involving new backend services and model updates), and a Create Site toggle for automatic site generation. Each feature involved significant UI/UX adjustments, layout reordering for optimal presentation (e.g., inline search bars, toggles aligned with headers), and integration with both frontend state and backend APIs/models. The engineer consistently addressed UI positioning, styling, validation, and backend data persistence. The work also included fixing an unrelated critical build error in  and enhancing the email template system. The current focus is on adding file upload capabilities to the Additional Information section.

The application, an admin dashboard for snow removal, requires a highly intuitive UI/UX with standardized headers, tabbed navigation, and responsive design. Core features include a Communication Center, a robust Template System, Work Orders, Purchase Orders, and Operations Dashboard, along with advanced automations (Service Lifecycle, Fleet Tracking, Weather-Driven Dispatch, Analytics). Recent development has focused on enhancing the  page. This involves:
1.  Replacing a Link to Company dropdown with a toggle-controlled search bar.
2.  Adding Communication Preference (SMS/InApp) options that conditionally make the mobile number required.
3.  Implementing a Require Access toggle that, when active, reveals Web/InApp access options and a user role dropdown, triggering user account creation with email credentials.
4.  Adding a Create Site toggle with a conditional Site Name field, to automatically create a site upon customer saving.
5.  Extensive UI/UX refinements for all new elements, including layout adjustments, alignment, and sizing.
6.  Changing Individual to Contact across relevant sections.
7.  Enhancing the address input with a Google logo and robust city population.
8.  Adding a Create Customer and Cancel button at the form's bottom, replacing a header action.
9.  Converting Active Customer checkbox to a toggle, moving it to the Contact Information header.
10. Moving the Create Site toggle to the Address header.
11. Adding document/photo upload functionality under Additional Information.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently implementing a user request on the  file to add document and photo upload functionality under the Additional Information section. Before the trajectory ended, the engineer had completed the backend logic and state management necessary for this feature on the frontend. Specifically, the following states were added to the  component:  (to store an array of files),  (for tracking upload status), and  (for handling any issues). Additionally, necessary icons (, , ) were imported, and the core handler functions for file selection (), initiating upload (), and removing files () have been defined. The immediate next step is to integrate these functions with the actual JSX elements in the Additional Notes section to provide the visual interface for users to interact with the file upload feature.
