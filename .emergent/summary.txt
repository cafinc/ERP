The AI engineer successfully guided the application from its initial state to a feature-rich platform, primarily focusing on the Next.js web admin dashboard and its FastAPI backend. Key initial efforts included robust QuickBooks Online integration and significant customer creation form improvements. Subsequent work systematically addressed a comprehensive product roadmap. This involved fixing a non-functional photo upload, redesigning the Estimates page, enhancing Project views (including a critical error fix for ID handling), adding CSV/PDF export to Invoices, and auditing the Sites page.

Furthermore, several new enterprise modules were introduced: Automated Reporting, Automation Analytics, Visual Workflow Execution History, Access Control, and Inventory/Assets. Crucially, backend APIs for Inventory, Access Control, and Automation Analytics were developed and thoroughly tested before integrating with their respective frontend pages, replacing mock data. Throughout, the engineer resolved build errors, suppressed noisy logs, and navigated complex Git push protection issues stemming from secrets in commit history. The current task involves a comprehensive audit of all web-admin pages and integrating previously hidden features into the main navigation sidebar, ensuring full discoverability and accessibility.

<product_requirements>
The core product is a comprehensive Next.js web admin dashboard for snow removal, mirroring an Expo mobile app, with modules for Estimates, Projects, Invoices, Customers, Sites, and Dispatch. Initial requirements included QuickBooks Online Integration (customers, invoices, payments, estimates sync, configuration, troubleshooting) and significant customer creation form improvements (individual focus, separated names, mobile number, verified address, formatted phone, company contact linking).

A detailed roadmap was provided, encompassing:
*   Dashboard & Navigation: Audit, link stats cards, add feedback, test mobile responsiveness.
*   Customers, Estimates, Projects, Invoices, Sites Pages: Redesigns, feature additions (grid/list views, forms, relationships, progress tracking, filtering, exports).
*   Access Dashboard: Role-based access, granular permissions, audit logging.
*   Inventory/Assets Module: Tracking, alerts, supplier info.
*   Dispatch Dashboard: Live map, drag-and-drop, filtering, schedule sync.
The work also addressed specific bugs: a non-functional Select Files button in the photo upload modal and a 400 error on the project detail page. The most recent explicit request was to ensure all web-admin pages are discoverable via the main navigation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on a comprehensive audit and update of the web-admin navigation. The user explicitly requested to expose all hidden pages that were not accessible from the main navigation sidebar. This involves modifying the  file. The engineer had identified numerous unlinked pages (e.g., Inventory, Leads, Photos, Geofence, Weather, Tracking, Shifts, Agreements, Consumables analytics) and was in the process of adding navigation links for these features, organizing them within the existing sidebar structure. The last action in the trajectory was an edit to  and a note that missing icon imports still needed to be added and the web-admin service restarted to complete this task. This is an ongoing task to ensure all features are discoverable and accessible through the main UI.

<optional_next_step>
Add the remaining missing icon imports to  and restart the web-admin service.
