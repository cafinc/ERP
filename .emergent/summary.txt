The AI engineer's trajectory involved a significant expansion of the application, addressing both initial product requirements and new user requests. Initially, the focus was on establishing a theme toggling system and creating backend infrastructure for a comprehensive task assignment system, including models, a notification service, and CRUD routes. The work progressed to building frontend screens for task management and a notification center for the mobile app. A critical pivot occurred when the user clarified that features built for the mobile app () were also required for the web admin (), leading to the porting of the task management, customer, and crew portal features to the Next.js web admin structure, mirroring existing design patterns. The project concluded with the AI engineer reporting 100% completion, having implemented the core task system, portals, and theme toggle across both platforms.

<product_requirements>
The application is a comprehensive admin dashboard for snow removal services, requiring an intuitive and polished user experience. Key features include a Communication Center (InApp, SMS, Email, Phone), a unified Communication Center in the header, and a Template System for estimates/invoices with placeholders. UI/UX enhancements demanded standardized headers, tabbed navigation, real-time validation, phone number formatting, bubble-style conversation history, emoji avatars, and a redesigned . This header evolved to include a quick-add button, search, alerts, communications, activity, and a hamburger menu with logo upload, sticky behavior, keyboard shortcuts, notification badges, mobile responsiveness, theme toggle, and accessibility. Navigation was restructured (e.g., CRM to Sales, Automation under Settings, new Operations menu). Additionally, new Work Orders, Purchase Orders, and Operations Dashboard pages were required, following the Customers page design. A new, major request emerged: a comprehensive task assignment system with in-app notifications for users, including customers, for work orders, estimates, invoices, and forms.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed the extensive task of porting the newly developed features from the Expo mobile app to the Next.js web admin dashboard, ensuring feature parity across platforms as requested by the user (Keep Both option).

Specifically:
1.  **Web Admin Porting**: After creating the task management system, theme toggle, customer portal, and crew portal for the mobile app (), the AI engineer began replicating these features within the  structure.
2.  **Web Admin Customer Portal**: New pages for the web admin customer portal were created, including:
    *    (Customer Portal Dashboard)
    *    (Customer Estimates)
    *    (Customer Invoices)
3.  **Web Admin Crew Portal**: New pages for the web admin crew portal were created, including:
    *    (Crew Portal Dashboard)
    *    (Crew Tasks)
4.  **Design Consistency**: These new web admin pages were designed to match the existing patterns observed in , ensuring a consistent UI/UX.
5.  **Task Management**: The backend for the task management system (models, services, routes) and its integration points were successfully established and registered in . Frontend components for task display were also created for both mobile and web admin.

The current state is that the primary features, including the task assignment system, theme toggle, customer portal, and crew portal, have been implemented for both the mobile Expo application and the Next.js web administration dashboard, fulfilling the Keep Both requirement. The AI engineer reported reaching 100% completion.
