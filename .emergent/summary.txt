<analysis>
The AI engineer's work in this trajectory primarily focused on two main objectives. Initially, it involved debugging a  error in  which was blocking further development. The engineer successfully diagnosed that  was already imported, then identified and corrected the Next.js service name ( instead of ) for restart, effectively resolving the error. Following this, the engineer proceeded to enhance the Asset Analytics Dashboard () by integrating . This involved adding comprehensive charts (utilization, distribution, cost, maintenance, status), date range filters, and an AI-powered insights panel. The successful implementation was verified through a frontend screenshot. The trajectory concluded with a new explicit request from the user to address web admin JSK issues, which the engineer began investigating.

<product_requirements>
The overarching goal is to modernize ERP web administration and enhance field service management, extending existing core features. Key requirements include:
1.  **Access Control**: A universal page with tabbed navigation for internal/external roles, user/role management, and form validation.
2.  **Asset Management**: Renaming Equipment to Asset, enhancing the Asset Dashboard with categories and quick actions, implementing advanced filtering, sorting, bulk actions, export, and an asset comparison feature. Integration of asset inspections with forms.
3.  **Forms Management**: A rebuilt forms page featuring category filtering, search, sorting, analytics dashboard, bulk actions for templates, submission tab enhancements, template management, quick actions, and UI/UX improvements.
4.  **Site Maps**: Full implementation of measurement tools (Area, Distance) with popups and clickable items for editing.
5.  **UI/UX Consistency**: Systematic addition of icons to all major page headers.
6.  **Templates**: Creation of a professional document template builder with visual design, custom layout, drag-and-drop, resizing, and pre-built layouts, accessible from the  page.
7.  **Communications**: Re-implementation of  as a comprehensive system, integrating with .
8.  **Analytics**: Development of an Asset Analytics Dashboard with charts and insights.
The Asset Analytics Dashboard (requirement 8) was the immediate focus during this trajectory.

useEffect

-   ****: This file represents the Asset Dashboard. In this trajectory, it was significantly enhanced to include comprehensive analytics. This involved adding  components for visual data representation (e.g., utilization trends, distribution, cost analysis, maintenance tracking, status overview), implementing date range filters, and an AI-powered insights panel.
-   ****: This file contains the new visual template designer. It was previously identified with a . During this trajectory, the issue was investigated, confirmed that  was already imported, and the error was resolved by correctly restarting the  service.
-   ****: This file defines the project's dependencies. It was confirmed that  was already listed as a dependency, which was then utilized for developing the Asset Analytics Dashboard.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Systematically add icons to all major page headers (this task remains from previous cycles).
-   Address web admin JSX issues and rebuild pages if necessary (this is the user's most recent explicit request).
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had successfully completed the enhancement of the **Asset Analytics Dashboard** in . This involved integrating various charts from  to display utilization trends, asset distribution, cost analysis, maintenance tracking, and a status overview, along with date range filters and an AI-powered insights panel. The functionality was verified via a screenshot, and no critical errors were found in the logs.

Following this, the user provided a new explicit request: address web admin JSK issues, rebuild pages if needed. The AI engineer acknowledged this and began examining for current errors, noting an  warning in the logs, but had not yet identified specific JSX issues or taken corrective action beyond initiating the investigation by taking a screenshot to capture browser console logs. The work is currently focused on diagnosing and resolving potential JSX-related problems within the  application.
