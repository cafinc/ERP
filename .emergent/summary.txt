The trajectory details an extensive design system overhaul and navigation refinement for the application. Initially, the AI addressed user feedback regarding design inconsistencies across the HR Module and Integration Hub, applying a standard  and consistent styling. Following a high-level comparison to ServiceTitan, the user guided the AI through an iterative design process, exploring multiple visual themes, navigation layouts (settling on a Hybrid Navigation with a top bar and icons), button styles, and font choices. The AI proactively built interactive selector pages (, , , ) to facilitate user decisions. Critical issues like a hydration error from date formatting and the Enhanced Header blocking the top navigation were identified and fixed. The final focus shifted to meticulously aligning navigation structure, ensuring all pages are accessible, optimizing menu entries, and correcting menu icons to match their respective pages. The process highlights a highly collaborative, user-driven design iteration loop.

The application is a full-stack admin dashboard (Next.js, FastAPI, MongoDB) for snow removal, with an Expo mobile app. Initial features included QuickBooks integration, customer forms, dashboard, operational pages (Customers, Estimates, Projects, Invoices, Sites), and Access Dashboard. Recently, Site Map Annotation (Google Maps with drawing/measurement), UI/UX Modernization, a comprehensive Settings submenu, Navigation Enhancements, Avatar Emoji System, White-Label Branding, and Advanced User Roles & Permissions were implemented.

The current focus involves:
- **HR Module**: Foundation, navigation, employee management (CRUD, profiles, documents, emergency contacts), time & attendance (tracking, timesheets, clock in/out, GPS), PTO management, training/certifications, payroll setup, performance management.
- **Integration Hub**: Dashboard, QuickBooks (Payroll, Time Tracking, Employee sync), Microsoft 365 (Azure AD SSO, Teams, Outlook, OneDrive, Power BI), all with mock flows.
- **Site Maps Tab Enhancements**: Integration under Dispatch, fix drawing inaccuracies, enable drag-and-drop for feature icons, add page scrollability, implement 15 additional map editor features (e.g., snap-to-grid, undo/redo).

<current_work>
The AI engineer has been meticulously working on refining the application's design system and navigation based on explicit user feedback. Initially, the AI addressed widespread design inconsistencies across the newly built HR and Integration Hub modules, standardizing their layout and styling by ensuring they use  and consistent card structures.

A significant portion of the recent work involved creating a highly customizable design system. This included:
1.  **Design Variations**: Creating , ,  to present different aesthetic choices.
2.  **Design System Demo**: Developing  to showcase color palettes, navigation types, and button variations for user selection.
3.  **Custom Palette**: Creating a Header Inspired color palette based on the 's blue ().
4.  **Navigation**: Implementing a Hybrid Navigation (, ) with selected button styles.
5.  **Layout Selectors**: Creating  and  for comprehensive design element and page layout selection.
6.  **Navigation Builder**: Creating  (later changed to click-to-add functionality) to allow the user to define their navigation structure.

Several issues were resolved:
-   **Header Overlap**: Fixed the  to prevent it from blocking the top navigation.
-   **Hydration Error**: Resolved a client/server mismatch in  caused by dynamic date rendering.
-   **Submenu Display**: Explored various submenu options (e.g., ).
-   **Icons in Top Bar**: Integrated icons into the chosen top bar navigation.

Most recently, the AI focused on the  to:
-   Match the navigation structure exactly to the user's original , placing missing pages under Settings.
-   Optimize navigation by combining/removing duplicate pages as per AI recommendations, which were approved by the user.
-   Ensure the top menu bar remains open when clicking a dashboard icon to view submenu items.
-   Update menu icons to accurately reflect the content of their respective pages, which was the very last action performed via multiple  calls to .
