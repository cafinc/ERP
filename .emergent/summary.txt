The AI engineer primarily focused on implementing and refining features across a Next.js web admin dashboard. Initial work involved completing the QuickBooks Online integration, including manual sync buttons for customers, invoices, and estimates. This led to backend model fixes for accounting data persistence and email validation. Subsequent tasks included a series of quick wins like adding an Add Sites button, updating a navigation icon, and standardizing search bar sizes. Major feature implementations followed, covering Geofence Management UI, Route Optimization UI, Recurring Services, and Lead Management. A significant portion of the recent work involved systematically resolving build errors, API 500 errors due to data validation, and hydration mismatches, culminating in a full platform audit. The audit identified a single non-functional button in the photo upload modal, which the engineer was actively fixing when the trajectory ended.

<product_requirements>
The core product is a comprehensive Next.js web admin dashboard mirroring an Expo mobile app for snow removal operations, featuring modules like Estimates, Projects, Invoices, Customers, Sites, and Dispatch. Key recent additions included a Forms System, enhanced Geofence, redesigned Customer Management, and a real-time Messaging System. The immediate, explicit request driving much of the work was **QuickBooks Online Integration** for syncing customers, invoices, payments, and estimates, along with handling configuration and troubleshooting. This also included specific **customer creation form improvements**: defaulting to individual, separate first/last names, mobile number, broken-out address with Google verification, formatted phone number, and company main contact linking. Later, the user provided a comprehensive roadmap for fixing **Dashboard & Navigation**, **Customers Page** (grid view with pictures), **Estimates Page** (form-like view), **Projects Page** (navigation, linking, progress tracking), **Invoices & Finances** (filtering, KPIs, export), **Access Dashboard** (role-based access), **Inventory/Assets**, **Dispatch Dashboard** (live map), and **Sites Page** (service card layout), followed by a full platform audit and specific bug fixes.

- ****:
    - **Changes**: Implemented manual Sync Now buttons for Customers, Invoices, Payments, Estimates. Connected these buttons to backend API endpoints (, , , ).
    - **Importance**: Provides user control over QuickBooks data synchronization, crucial after automatic sync was removed from customer creation.
- ****:
    - **Changes**: Underwent a complete overhaul. The AI engineer created a new enhanced version of the form (initially in ) and replaced the old file. This involved adding a Sites section for company customers.
    - **Importance**: Implements the user's requested significant improvements for customer data entry, enhancing user experience and data capture.
- ****:
    - **Changes**: Replaced the  icon used for Trailers in the navigation sidebar with  for better visual representation.
    - **Importance**: Improves UI/UX by using more appropriate iconography.
- ****:
    - **Changes**: Made the dashboard stats cards clickable and linked them to their respective navigation routes, adding hover effects.
    - **Importance**: Improves dashboard usability by making key performance indicators navigable.
- ****:
    - **Changes**: Added a Map View toggle and a basic map placeholder, conditionalizing the display between the existing list view and the new map view.
    - **Importance**: Enhances dispatch functionality by introducing a visual, map-based interface for operations.
- ** & **:
    - **Changes**: Implemented both grid and list view components, allowing users to toggle between them. Added explicit toggle buttons and set the default view to 'grid' for immediate visibility of the new design. Fixed multiple JSX parsing errors in  during this implementation.
    - **Importance**: Provides a more flexible and visually rich way to browse customer and project data, standardizing the UI pattern.
- ****:
    - **Changes**: Fixed a JSX syntax error ( incompleteness) and a hydration mismatch error related to .
    - **Importance**: Ensures the customer portal dashboard builds correctly and displays consistent date formats across server and client, resolving critical display issues.
- ****:
    - **Changes**: Currently being updated to fix a non-functional Select Files button in the photo upload modal by adding a file input and an  handler.
    - **Importance**: Addresses a critical bug identified during the platform audit, enabling core photo upload functionality.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the final stages of a **Full Platform Audit**, specifically addressing the single remaining identified bug. The  reported that **only one button was actually broken** across the entire application: the Select Files button within the photos upload modal.

The engineer was working on fixing this issue, located in . The current action involved adding a file input element and a proper  handler to enable the functionality of selecting files for upload. The trajectory ends with the engineer about to implement the UI button update and file input element, indicating the fix for the photo upload functionality is underway but not yet complete or tested. This is the last active development task.
