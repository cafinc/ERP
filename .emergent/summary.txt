The AI engineer successfully navigated a complex, iterative development process focused on standardizing the web-admin UI and integrating new backend features. Key phases included: initially addressing Agreements page branding and template integration, which led to significant refactoring to ensure consistency with a customer page golden standard. This involved fixing navigation, resolving backend API 404/500 errors by creating  and , and correcting  component prop issues. A major effort was the bulk standardization of over 140 pages, involving multiple script-driven updates to apply a consistent header style, breadcrumbs, subtitles, and modern layouts, as well as the complete removal of the left sidebar navigation. The final phase involved debugging persistent UI errors related to header component usage and page structure, culminating in a reported 100% standardization. The current task involves modifying the  page to replace a dropdown with a toggle and search bar for company linking. The process highlighted iterative refinement based on user feedback and persistent debugging of caching and component usage issues.

The application serves as an admin dashboard for snow removal services, emphasizing intuitive UI/UX. Core features include a Communication Center, unified headers, and a Template System. UI/UX guidelines demanded standardized headers, tabbed navigation, real-time validation, and responsive design, with a  incorporating quick-add, search, and activity features. Key functional areas like Work Orders, Purchase Orders, and Operations Dashboard were required, alongside a comprehensive task assignment and in-app notification system for various user roles. Autonomous execution targets included backend bug fixes, and integrating Service Lifecycle Automation (Projects), Real-Time Fleet Tracking, Weather-Driven Dispatch, Advanced Analytics, and Unified Communications. Further features included Weather Alerts, WebSocket Real-Time Sync (web-admin), Offline Mode (mobile), a full Notification System, Dispatch Planning Board, Smart Equipment Ecosystem with UI, Site Maps with geo-fencing and property measurement, and consistent  layout.

Recent explicit requests from the user included:
- Updating the Agreements page with branding ( blue) and an agreement template in its header, including a dropdown for template management, matching the customer page's style.
- All new pages must be automatically added to the navigation.
- Standardizing all dropdown pages to match the customer page header style and branding, removing duplicate pages, and adding missing ones.
- Restructuring navigation: removing duplicate Estimates and Invoices from CRM/Finance, adding an Operations tab with Work Orders, Purchase Orders, and Operations Dashboard.
- Completing a modern update across all pages, reviewing and enhancing layouts with cards, shadows, rounded corners, and better spacing, and confirming the removal of the old sidebar navigation.
- On the  page, changing the Link to Company field from a dropdown to a toggle, which, when active, reveals a search bar connected to backend company data.

**Key Files and Changes:**
-   ** (NEW):** Provides full CRUD API endpoints () for managing agreement templates. Essential for the Agreements page functionality.
-   ** (NEW):** Provides full CRUD API endpoints () for managing leads. Addressed a 404 API error on the frontend leads page.
-   ** (MODIFIED):** The main FastAPI application entry point. It was modified to import and register the new  and . Crucially, database import patterns were standardized to avoid .
-   ** (MODIFIED):** This component manages the primary navigation and overall layout of the web-admin. It underwent significant changes to:
    -   Restructure the navigation menu (removed duplicates like Estimates from CRM, Invoices from Finance, and /agreements).
    -   Added a new Operations section with Work Orders, Purchase Orders, and Operations Dashboard.
    -   Removed the entire left sidebar navigation structure, including associated state and layout logic, to achieve a full-width, modernized layout.
    -   Added imports for new navigation icons (, ).
-   ** (NEW then MODIFIED):** Initially created as the main agreements page. It was then completely rewritten to match the exact styling and prop usage of  from the  page, including tabs, search, breadcrumbs, and branding.
-   ** (MODIFIED):** Identified as the original Agreements page. It was extensively modified to adopt the standardized  style, branding, and template integration, becoming the canonical Agreements page that the navigation now points to.
-   ** (REFERENCED):** This page's header style and structure served as the golden standard for the  component's usage and overall layout across the entire web-admin application.
-   ** (CURRENTLY MODIFIED):** This page is currently being updated to transform the Link to Company input from a dropdown into a toggle-controlled search bar for company linking.
-   ** (MODIFIED):** The main dashboard page. Its  component usage was fixed to remove invalid  and  props and ensure proper structural integration, resolving runtime errors.
-   ** (MODIFIED):** Fixed a syntax/parsing error caused by incorrect  integration leading to mismatched  tags.
-   **Numerous other  pages (MODIFIED via scripts):** Over 140 pages were systematically updated to:
    -   Replace old header components (, , ) with the  component.
    -   Correctly configure  props (e.g., converting / to JSX elements for ).
    -   Apply consistent branding ().
    -   Add proper breadcrumbs and subtitles.
    -   Implement modern layout enhancements (cards, shadows, rounded corners, improved spacing).
-   ** (NEW):** A Python script developed to automate the auditing, analysis, and bulk modification of  pages, significantly expediting the standardization process.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently implementing a user request on the  file. The goal is to transform the Link to Company input field. Instead of a standard dropdown or direct input, it needs to be a toggle. When this toggle is activated, a search bar should appear, allowing the user to dynamically search for and connect the customer (being created/edited) to an existing company in the system via a backend API.

The engineer has already identified the relevant section in the  file and has successfully applied an initial edit (Chat Message 493) to replace the existing structure with a toggle and the framework for a search bar. The immediate next step (Chat Message 494) is to define and add the necessary React state variables within the component to manage the visual and functional aspects of this new toggle and search feature (e.g.,  boolean,  string). This task is in progress, focusing on the frontend UI logic before backend integration.
