The AI engineer's work trajectory encompassed several critical phases. Initially, it involved resolving a  error and successfully integrating  for the Asset Analytics Dashboard. The focus then shifted to extensive web admin JSK issues, systematically addressing hardcoded URLs, invalid styles, and setting up Next.js API proxying. A significant challenge was resolving numerous complex JSX syntax errors across  files. The AI successfully deleted a massively corrupted  file, then iteratively fixed JSX errors in , , , , , and . After these fixes, a Turbopack cache issue was resolved by the troubleshoot agent, stabilizing the  build. Subsequently, a default admin user was created to address a web-admin  redirect, and then a detailed ERP completion game plan was developed and initiated, focusing on Accounts Payable and Vendor Management backend and frontend, and now moving into Accounts Receivable.

The overarching goal is to modernize ERP web administration and enhance field service management by extending existing core features. This includes:
1.  **Access Control**: Universal page with role management and form validation.
2.  **Asset Management**: Renaming Equipment to Asset, enhancing its dashboard with categories, quick actions, advanced filtering, sorting, bulk actions, export, comparison, and inspections integration.
3.  **Forms Management**: Rebuilt forms page with category filtering, search, sorting, analytics, bulk actions for templates, and UI/UX improvements.
4.  **Site Maps**: Full implementation of measurement tools (Area, Distance).
5.  **UI/UX Consistency**: Systematic addition of icons to all major page headers.
6.  **Templates**: Professional visual document template builder.
7.  **Communications**: Re-implementation of  as a comprehensive system.
8.  **Analytics**: Development of an Asset Analytics Dashboard with charts and insights.

The Asset Analytics Dashboard (requirement 8) was substantially implemented, and the trajectory also saw the initiation of new ERP modules, specifically Accounts Payable and Vendor Management, with a plan to proceed with Accounts Receivable.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was actively working on implementing **Sprint 1.2: Accounts Receivable (AR)** as part of the broader ERP completion game plan.

The last completed action was:
-   **Creating the backend routes for Accounts Receivable**: A new file, , was created. This file is intended to define all necessary API endpoints for AR functionalities, such as managing invoices and collections. The assistant explicitly stated AR backend created with 11 new endpoints.

The work was poised to register these new AR routes into the main  file, and then proceed with developing the corresponding frontend components, starting with an AR Dashboard. This indicates a strong continuation of the modular ERP build-out, with the backend foundation for AR now in place.
