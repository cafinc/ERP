The AI engineer's work trajectory chronicles a highly iterative, user-driven development process focused on refining the application's UI/UX and expanding its communication capabilities. The initial phase involved standardizing page headers with the  component, addressing various layout inconsistencies, and resolving JSX parsing and React Hooks errors in the  and  pages. A significant portion of the conversation was dedicated to debugging persistent JSX errors in  during an attempt to implement a frosted glass modal effect, which was eventually simplified to a full-screen  integration due to complexity.

Subsequent user requests led to the removal of the Revenue Overview section from the CRM dashboard and a major overhaul of the Communication Center on the customer detail page. This involved transforming navigation to tabs, introducing interactive colored communication type buttons on the Overview tab, and building a comprehensive Communications tab with sub-tabs, messaging interfaces (InApp, SMS, Email, Phone), and integration points for RingCentral and Gmail. The AI also implemented system-wide phone number auto-formatting, email validation, and real-time field validation with visual error indicators.

The final phase shifted towards backend integration, with the AI successfully implementing FastAPI routes for RingCentral and Gmail communication (sending messages) and developing real-time webhook listeners for both services. The trajectory concludes with the AI embarking on an ambitious autonomous build plan to deliver advanced Communication Center features, including file attachments and read receipts for the customer portal, but was cut short before full completion due to token limits, pivoting to a continuation package for foundational elements like file storage.

    *   Communications tab: full interface with sub-tabs for each type (InApp, SMS, Email, Phone), show all types regardless of activity, display No comms if empty, include reply box for messaging, integrate with RingCentral (phone/SMS) and Gmail (email).
    *   Implement backend integrations for RingCentral (SMS send/receive) and Gmail (email send/receive).
    *   Implement real-time webhook listeners for incoming RingCentral and Gmail messages.
    *   Extend to customer portal, crew, and subcontractor access.
    *   Add document/photo sending/receiving, read receipt functionality.
    *   Further features: real-time messaging, multiple file uploads, file preview, basic search, message templates, analytics, AI chatbot, video calls.
*   **Platform-Wide Validation**: Auto-format phone numbers to  and validate email structure system-wide. Implement real-time red border/error message validation for invalid/required fields on forms.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in the autonomous build plan for the Communication Center. Specifically, it had just initiated BLOCK 1 - File Storage System by creating the file . The last instruction received and acknowledged was to continue the autonomous build and complete the file upload endpoints and wire everything together. This indicates the current work is focused on implementing the backend logic for file storage and upload, which is a foundational step for enabling document and photo attachments within the Communication Center, aligning with Phase 1 of the autonomous build plan.
