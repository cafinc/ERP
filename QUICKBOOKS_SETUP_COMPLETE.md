  -d '{
    "DisplayName": "Test Customer",

### Example: When you create an invoice in your system

1. Invoice is created in your database
2. If auto-sync is enabled for invoices
3. System checks if customer exists in QuickBooks
4. If not, creates the customer first
5. Then creates the invoice in QuickBooks
6. Logs the operation in sync logs
7. You can view the sync status in the activity log

---

## üìù Sync Activity Logs

View all sync operations in real-time:

1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí QuickBooks**
2. Scroll to **Recent Sync Activity**
3. See status (‚úì success or ‚ö† error)
4. View entity type, operation, and timestamp
5. Check error messages for failed syncs

## üîê Security Features

‚úÖ **Auto Refresh** - Access tokens refresh automatically  
‚úÖ **Audit Trail** - Complete logging of all operations

---

## üö® Important Notes

### Token Expiration

- **Access Tokens**: Expire after 1 hour (auto-refreshed)
- **Refresh Tokens**: Expire after 100 days
- System automatically refreshes tokens before expiration
- If refresh token expires, you'll need to reconnect

### Sandbox vs Production

Currently configured for **Sandbox** (testing):
- Uses sandbox QuickBooks companies
- Safe to test without affecting real data
- No actual transactions

**To switch to Production:**
1. Change `QUICKBOOKS_ENVIRONMENT=production` in `.env`
2. Update credentials to production keys
3. Restart backend
4. Reconnect to QuickBooks

### Rate Limits

QuickBooks limits:
- **500 requests per minute** per company
- **10 concurrent requests** maximum
- System includes automatic retry with backoff

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Can't connect?

1. **Check redirect URI** in QuickBooks app settings
2. **Verify credentials** are correct in `.env`
3. **Restart backend**: `sudo supervisorctl restart backend`
4. **Check backend logs**: `sudo supervisorctl tail backend`

### Sync failing?

1. **Check sync logs** in the UI for error messages
2. **Verify entity exists** in QuickBooks (e.g., customer before invoice)
3. **Check required fields** match QuickBooks requirements
4. **Token expired?** Disconnect and reconnect

### Connection shows disconnected?

1. **Check token expiration** - may need to reconnect
2. **Verify credentials** in `.env` file
3. **Test connection endpoint** with curl
