  Build complete HR Module and Integration Hub overnight autonomously.
  
  HR Module includes:
  - Employee Management (CRUD, profiles, documents, emergency contacts)
  - Time & Attendance (clock in/out, timesheets, approvals, GPS tracking)
  - PTO Management (requests, approvals, balance tracking, calendar)
  - Training & Certifications (programs, assignments, tracking, expirations)
  - Performance Management (reviews, goals, ratings)
  - Payroll Settings & Configuration
  
  Integration Hub includes:
  - Integration Management (CRUD operations)
  - QuickBooks Integration (Payroll, Time Tracking sync - mock/placeholder)
  - Microsoft 365 Integration (Azure AD SSO, Teams, Outlook, OneDrive, Power BI - mock/placeholder)
  - Sync Logs tracking
  
  All integrations use mock/placeholder flows until API credentials are provided.
