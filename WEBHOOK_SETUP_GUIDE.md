## ðŸ“ž RingCentral Webhook Setup

### Step 1: Get Your Webhook URL
Your webhook URL is: `https://YOUR_DOMAIN.com/api/webhooks/ringcentral/sms`

Replace `YOUR_DOMAIN.com` with your actual deployed domain.

### Step 2: Create Webhook in RingCentral Dashboard

1. **Log in to RingCentral Developer Portal**
   - Go to: https://developers.ringcentral.com/
   - Navigate to "My Apps" or "Console"

2. **Create or Select Your App**
   - If you haven't created an app yet, create one
   - Note your Client ID and Client Secret

3. **Configure Webhooks**
   - Go to "Webhooks" or "Notifications" section
   - Click "Add Webhook" or "Create Subscription"

4. **SMS Webhook Configuration:**
   ```
   Event Type: Instant Message Notifications
   OR
   Event Filter: /restapi/v1.0/account/~/extension/~/message-store
   
   Delivery Mode: Webhook
   Address: https://YOUR_DOMAIN.com/api/webhooks/ringcentral/sms
   ```

5. **Call Webhook Configuration:**
   ```
   Event Type: Telephony Sessions Notifications
   OR  
   Event Filter: /restapi/v1.0/account/~/extension/~/telephony/sessions
   
   Delivery Mode: Webhook
   Address: https://YOUR_DOMAIN.com/api/webhooks/ringcentral/call
   ```

6. **Webhook Validation:**
   - RingCentral will send a validation request with a `Validation-Token` header
   - Our webhook automatically handles this and responds correctly
   - You should see "Webhook verified" status

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

Add these to your `/app/backend/.env` file:

```bash
RINGCENTRAL_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
RINGCENTRAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
RINGCENTRAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here
```

The webhook secret is used to verify that requests are really from RingCentral.

### Step 4: Test It!

1. Send an SMS to your RingCentral number from a customer's phone
2. Check your backend logs: `tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.out.log`
3. You should see: "Incoming SMS saved: [phone] -> [your_number]"
4. The SMS will instantly appear in the Communication Center!

## ðŸ“§ Gmail Webhook Setup (Cloud Pub/Sub)

Gmail webhooks use Google Cloud Pub/Sub for push notifications.

### Step 1: Set Up Google Cloud Pub/Sub

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**
   - https://console.cloud.google.com/

2. **Enable APIs**
   - Enable "Gmail API"
   - Enable "Cloud Pub/Sub API"

3. **Create a Pub/Sub Topic**
   ```
   Topic Name: gmail-push-notifications
   ```

4. **Create a Push Subscription**
   ```
   Subscription Name: gmail-webhook-subscription
   Delivery Type: Push
   Endpoint URL: https://YOUR_DOMAIN.com/api/webhooks/gmail/push
   ```

5. **Grant Permissions**
   - Give `gmail-api-push@system.gserviceaccount.com` the "Pub/Sub Publisher" role on your topic

### Step 2: Enable Gmail Push for Your App

In your app's OAuth consent screen:
```
Scopes needed:
- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly
- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify
```

### Step 3: Watch Gmail Mailbox (Per User)

For each user who connects Gmail, you need to "watch" their mailbox:

```bash
POST https://gmail.googleapis.com/gmail/v1/users/me/watch
Authorization: Bearer [USER_ACCESS_TOKEN]
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "topicName": "projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/topics/gmail-push-notifications",
  "labelIds": ["INBOX"]
}
```

This tells Gmail to send push notifications when new emails arrive.

### Step 4: Renew Watch Periodically

Gmail watch subscriptions expire after 7 days. You need to renew them:
- Set up a cron job to call the watch endpoint every 6 days
- Or handle it when the webhook stops receiving notifications

### Step 5: Test It!

1. Send an email to the connected Gmail account
2. Check backend logs: `tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.out.log`
3. You should see: "Gmail push notification received for [email]"
4. Email appears instantly in Communication Center!

## ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices

### RingCentral Webhook Security:
- Webhooks include an `X-RingCentral-Signature` header
- Our code verifies this signature using your webhook secret
- Prevents unauthorized webhook calls

### Gmail Webhook Security:
- Google Cloud verifies your domain ownership
- Push subscriptions require authenticated setup
- Pub/Sub messages are cryptographically signed

### General:
- Always use HTTPS for webhook URLs
- Keep your webhook secrets safe in environment variables
- Monitor webhook logs for suspicious activity

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing Webhooks Locally

For local development, you can use **ngrok** to expose your local server:

```bash
# Install ngrok
npm install -g ngrok

# Expose your local backend
ngrok http 8001

# You'll get a URL like: https://abc123.ngrok.io
# Use this as your webhook URL: https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/ringcentral/sms
```

---

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring Webhooks

### Check Webhook Health:
```bash
curl https://YOUR_DOMAIN.com/api/webhooks/health
```

### View Webhook Logs:
```bash
tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.out.log | grep -i webhook
```

### Test RingCentral Webhook Manually:
```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR_DOMAIN.com/api/webhooks/ringcentral/sms \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Validation-Token: test123" \
  -d '{}'
```

---

## ðŸŽ‰ What Happens After Setup

Once webhooks are configured:

1. **Customer sends SMS** â†’ Instantly appears in Communication Center
2. **Customer calls** â†’ Call log automatically created
3. **Customer emails** â†’ Email shows up in real-time
4. **Staff replies** â†’ Sent via RingCentral/Gmail
5. **Everything synced** â†’ Complete conversation history in one place

---

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Webhooks Not Receiving Data:

1. **Check webhook URLs are correct**
   - Must be publicly accessible
   - Must use HTTPS in production

2. **Verify environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Check if set
   echo $RINGCENTRAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET
   ```

3. **Check backend logs**
   ```bash
   tail -100 /var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log
   ```

4. **Test webhook endpoint directly**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET https://YOUR_DOMAIN.com/api/webhooks/health
   ```

### RingCentral Issues:
- Verify app has proper permissions
- Check webhook status in RC dashboard
- Ensure validation token was handled correctly

### Gmail Issues:
- Confirm Pub/Sub topic and subscription are created
- Verify service account permissions
- Check that mailbox watch is active (expires after 7 days)
- Ensure Gmail API is enabled
