# Workflow Automation System Documentation

## Overview
The Snow Removal Platform includes a comprehensive automation system that handles routine tasks, reduces manual work, and improves operational efficiency.

## Automation Workflows

### 1. Service Completion Automation
**Trigger**: When a dispatch status changes to "completed"
**Automatic Actions**:
- ✅ Requests after photos from crew
- ✅ Generates service report PDF
- ✅ Sends completion notification to customer
- ✅ Auto-deducts consumables (salt, de-icer) from inventory
- ✅ Updates equipment usage hours
- ✅ Creates invoice automatically

**Manual Trigger**:
```bash
POST /api/automation/trigger/service_completion
{
  "dispatch_id": "68e8929ff0f6291c7d863496",
  "crew_id": "68e8929ff0f6291c7d863497"
}
```

### 2. Customer Communication Automation
**Triggers**: Various customer touchpoints
**Automatic Actions**:
- ✅ Estimate created - Sends email notification
- ✅ Project started - Sends notification
- ✅ Crew en route - Sends SMS with ETA
- ✅ Service completed - Sends notification with photos
- ✅ Invoice sent - Sends payment reminder
- ✅ Invoice overdue - Sends follow-up reminders

**Manual Trigger**:
```bash
POST /api/automation/trigger/customer_communication
{
  "trigger_type": "crew_enroute",
  "dispatch_id": "...",
  "customer_id": "...",
  "eta_minutes": 15
}
```

### 3. Equipment Maintenance Automation
**Schedule**: Daily at 6:00 AM
**Automatic Actions**:
- ✅ Checks all equipment for inspection due dates
- ✅ Sends reminders to crew for overdue inspections
- ✅ Auto-schedules maintenance for severely overdue equipment
- ✅ Tracks maintenance history

**Status Categories**:
- Current: ≤7 days since last inspection
- Due Soon: 8-30 days since last inspection
- Overdue: >30 days since last inspection
- Never Inspected: No inspection records

### 4. Weather-Based Operations
**Schedule**: Every 3 hours
**Automatic Actions**:
- ✅ Fetches weather forecast
- ✅ Assesses snow risk level (low/medium/high)
- ✅ Alerts crews on high snow risk
- ✅ Auto-creates priority dispatches for critical sites
- ✅ Adjusts route priorities based on forecast

**Snow Risk Levels**:
- Low: <30% chance of snow
- Medium: 30-60% chance of snow
- High: >60% chance of snow

### 5. Safety & Compliance Automation
**Schedule**: Daily at 7:00 AM
**Automatic Actions**:
- ✅ Sends daily safety check reminders to all crews
- ✅ Requires PPE verification photos
- ✅ Flags training certifications nearing expiry
- ✅ Tracks safety meeting attendance

### 6. Inventory Management Automation
**Schedule**: Every hour
**Automatic Actions**:
- ✅ Checks all consumables for low stock
- ✅ Sends low stock alerts to admin
- ✅ Auto-generates purchase orders for critical items
- ✅ Calculates usage rates and forecasts needs

**Stock Levels**:
- Normal: Above reorder level
- Low: At or below reorder level
- Critical: Below 50% of reorder level

## Scheduled Automation Timeline

### Daily
- **6:00 AM**: Equipment maintenance checks
- **7:00 AM**: Safety reminders to crews
- **9:00 AM**: Overdue invoice reminders

### Periodic
- **Every Hour**: Inventory stock level checks
- **Every 3 Hours**: Weather forecast updates

### Event-Driven
- **Dispatch Completed**: Service completion workflow
- **Geofence Entry/Exit**: Arrival/departure notifications
- **Photo Uploaded**: Customer notification
- **Low Stock Detected**: Purchase order generation

## API Endpoints

```

## Integration Points

### Geofence Integration
- Arrival at site triggers "crew_enroute" notification
- Departure triggers service completion checks

### Form System Integration
- Equipment inspection forms tracked for maintenance scheduling
- Safety check forms tracked for compliance

### Photo System Integration
- Before/after photos trigger customer notifications
- Photo uploads tracked in service completion workflow

### Weather API Integration
- Real-time forecasts drive operational decisions
- Snow risk assessment triggers crew alerts

### Consumables Integration
- Usage automatically deducted on service completion
- Inventory levels monitored continuously

## Configuration

### Enable/Disable Workflows
Workflows are enabled by default on system startup. To disable:
```python
# In background_scheduler.py
# Comment out the specific workflow task
# asyncio.create_task(self._daily_equipment_check())
```

### Adjust Schedule Times
```python
# In background_scheduler.py
# Change the hour/minute checks:
if now.hour == 6 and now.minute == 0:  # Equipment checks
if now.hour == 7 and now.minute == 0:  # Safety reminders
if now.hour == 9 and now.minute == 0:  # Invoice reminders
```

### Customize Thresholds
```python
# In automation_engine.py
# Equipment Maintenance thresholds:
if days_since_inspection > 30:  # Overdue
elif days_since_inspection > 21:  # Due soon

# Inventory thresholds:
if current_stock < reorder_level * 0.5:  # Critical
```

## Monitoring and Logs

### View Automation Logs
```bash
# Backend logs show all automation triggers
tail -f /var/log/supervisor/backend.out.log | grep "automation"
```

### Check Automation Activity
```http
GET /api/automation/status
```

### Monitor Workflow Execution
Each workflow returns detailed execution results:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "result": {
    "dispatch_id": "...",
    "steps_completed": [
      "after_photos_requested",
      "service_report_generated",
      "customer_notified",
      "consumables_deducted",
      "equipment_hours_updated",
      "invoice_created"
    ],
    "errors": []
  }
}
```
