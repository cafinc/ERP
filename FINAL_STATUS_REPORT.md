## üí° KEY TECHNICAL DECISIONS

### 1. WebSocket Architecture
**Decision:** Centralized connection manager with channel subscriptions
**Rationale:** Scalable, supports multi-device, event-driven
**Benefits:** Foundation for all real-time features in Phase 3

### 2. Work Order Implementation
**Decision:** Separate routes file vs modifying existing code
**Rationale:** Separation of concerns, easier maintenance
**Benefits:** Modular architecture, independent testing

### 3. Serialization Helpers
**Decision:** Reusable helper functions (serialize_doc, validate_object_id)
**Rationale:** DRY principle, consistency
**Benefits:** Less code duplication, easier to maintain

### 4. Real-Time Event Strategy
**Decision:** Emit events after successful operations
**Rationale:** Guarantee data consistency before notifications
**Benefits:** No race conditions, reliable updates

### 5. Error Handling
**Decision:** Standard HTTP codes (404, 422, 500)
**Rationale:** RESTful best practices
**Benefits:** Better frontend error handling, easier debugging
